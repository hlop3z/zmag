# Example **Use Cases**

- **Centralized Authentication**: Allows multiple applications to share a single authentication system, eliminating the need for individual authentication systems for each application and ensuring consistent security practices.
- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**: Ideal for organizations that need secure and efficient communication within their internal network for managing various business processes.
- **Local Database Applications**: Suitable for environments where high performance and data security are paramount, enabling quick access and secure handling of sensitive information.

## **Network Applications**:

Network applications are software programs that run on multiple computers and devices connected over a network (such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or the internet). These applications are designed to interact with a network to provide specific functionalities, such as messaging, database access, or remote management.

## **Key Characteristics**:

1. **Direct Communication**: Network applications often use protocols like TCP/IP to communicate directly over a network.
2. **Low Latency**: Network applications typically have lower latency due to direct communication over the network.
3. **Offline Capabilities**: Some network applications can work offline and synchronize data when a network connection is reestablished.
4. **Complex Configuration**: They often require more complex setup and configuration, especially when dealing with network security, firewalls, and access permissions.

## **Advantages**:

- **Performance**: Faster communication and data transfer speeds due to direct network connections.
- **Security**: Potentially more secure because they can operate within a private network environment.
- **Control and Customization**: Greater control over the network environment and application customization based on specific organizational needs.
